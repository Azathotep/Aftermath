{"name":"Aftermath","tagline":"A roguelike about survival in a zombie apocalypse","body":"Aftermath v0.0002\r\n============\r\n\r\nA [Roguelike](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation) zombie survival game\r\nwritten in C# using Monogame.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/Azathotep/Aftermath/raw/master//Images/screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\nThe city has been overrun by zombies! You are one of the few survivors.\r\n\r\nGame vision:\r\n\r\n - Sandbox simulation of a zombie outbreak in a large city environment.\r\n - A large and interesting city layout made up of roads and buildings, uniquely generated with each new game.\r\n - Thousands (as many as packs the city) zombies wandering the city.\r\n - Different zombie types (but not too many).\r\n - Simple controls and items.\r\n - Landmarks and special buildings like hospitals, airports, prisons, etc.\r\n - Everything in the world is persisted. Zombies do not spawn in nearby and vanish when out of sight.\r\n - Loot shops and homes to find ammunition, weapons, food and medical supplies.\r\n - Build a safehouse to protect self while sleeping or from zombie attacks.\r\n - Active events such as zombie horde attacks (similar to L4D) and attacks on the player's safehouse.\r\n - Customizable game options.\r\n - A storyline and clues concerning the cause of the outbreak and a possible cure, which the player is under no obligation to follow.\r\n\r\nIdeas for gameplay options:\r\n - UK rules. Guns and ammunition are rare. More reliance on melee weapons and running away.\r\n - US rules. Abundant guns and ammunition.\r\n - On The Same Team. Survivors do not attack each other.\r\n - Realistic Damage. Hostile survivors can kill you in one shot with weapons.\r\n - Not Immune. One zombie bite is fatal.\r\n - Afraid of the Dark. Game is always in daytime.\r\n\r\nThe current version is a small handdrawn map with a few roads, buildings and zombies.\r\n\r\nRequires monogame to build. The main dev trunk, not the latest release binaries.\r\nI am currently building off the fork I took (https://github.com/Azathotep/MonoGame)\r\nfrom the main dev trunk of Monogame.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
