The city has been overrun by zombies! You are one of the few survivors.

Game vision:

 - Sandbox simulation of a zombie outbreak in a large city environment.
 - A large and interesting city layout made up of roads and buildings, uniquely generated with each new game.
 - Thousands (as many as packs the city) zombies wandering the city.
 - Different zombie types (but not too many).
 - Simple controls and items.
 - Landmarks and special buildings like hospitals, airports, prisons, etc.
 - Everything in the world is persisted. Zombies do not spawn in nearby and vanish when out of sight.
 - Loot shops and homes to find ammunition, weapons, food and medical supplies.
 - Build a safehouse to protect self while sleeping or from zombie attacks.
 - Active events such as zombie horde attacks (similar to L4D) and attacks on the player's safehouse.
 - Customizable game options.
 - A storyline and clues concerning the cause of the outbreak and a possible cure, which the player is under no obligation to follow.

Ideas for gameplay options:
 - UK rules. Guns and ammunition are rare. More reliance on melee weapons and running away.
 - US rules. Abundant guns and ammunition.
 - On The Same Team. Survivors do not attack each other.
 - Realistic Damage. Hostile survivors can kill you in one shot with weapons.
 - Not Immune. One zombie bite is fatal.
 - Afraid of the Dark. Game is always in daytime.

The current version is a small handdrawn map with a few roads, buildings and zombies.

Requires monogame to build. The main dev trunk, not the latest release binaries.
I am currently building off the fork I took (https://github.com/Azathotep/MonoGame)
from the main dev trunk of Monogame.
