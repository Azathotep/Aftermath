<p>A <a href="http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Berlin_Interpretation">Roguelike</a> zombie survival game
written in C# using Monogame.</p>

<hr><p><img src="https://github.com/Azathotep/Aftermath/raw/master//Images/screenshot1.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>The city has been overrun by zombies! You are one of the few survivors.</p>

<p>Game vision:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sandbox simulation of a zombie outbreak in a large city environment.</li>
<li>A large and interesting city layout made up of roads and buildings, uniquely generated with each new game.</li>
<li>Thousands (as many as packs the city) zombies wandering the city.</li>
<li>Different zombie types (but not too many).</li>
<li>Simple controls and items.</li>
<li>Landmarks and special buildings like hospitals, airports, prisons, etc.</li>
<li>Everything in the world is persisted. Zombies do not spawn in nearby and vanish when out of sight.</li>
<li>Loot shops and homes to find ammunition, weapons, food and medical supplies.</li>
<li>Build a safehouse to protect self while sleeping or from zombie attacks.</li>
<li>Active events such as zombie horde attacks (similar to L4D) and attacks on the player's safehouse.</li>
<li>Customizable game options.</li>
<li>A storyline and clues concerning the cause of the outbreak and a possible cure, which the player is under no obligation to follow.</li>
</ul><p>Ideas for gameplay options:</p>

<ul>
<li>UK rules. Guns and ammunition are rare. More reliance on melee weapons and running away.</li>
<li>US rules. Abundant guns and ammunition.</li>
<li>On The Same Team. Survivors do not attack each other.</li>
<li>Realistic Damage. Hostile survivors can kill you in one shot with weapons.</li>
<li>Not Immune. One zombie bite is fatal.</li>
<li>Afraid of the Dark. Game is always in daytime.</li>
</ul><p>The current version is a small handdrawn map with a few roads, buildings and zombies.</p>

<p>Requires monogame to build. The main dev trunk, not the latest release binaries.
I am currently building off the fork I took (<a href="https://github.com/Azathotep/MonoGame">https://github.com/Azathotep/MonoGame</a>)
from the main dev trunk of Monogame.</p>
